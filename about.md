I am a PostDoc researcher in the Earth Surface Dynamics group at the ETH zurich. I am broadly interested in the co-evolution of landscape processes and biodiversity patterns. I investigated what shapes the plant biodiversity and turnover in the Hengduan Mountains, China â€“ an exceptional biodiversity hotspot outside the tropics. The historical (e.g. tectonic) and contemporary (e.g. climate) processes may have an integrated impact on the plant biodiversity patterns. Thus, one of the main aims of my Ph.D. project is disentangling these processes. Besides, I will also investigate functional and phylogenetic diversity to supplement taxonomic diversity, trying to get a holistic view of the biodiversity patterns and how they structured spatially. I did my master in the University of Copenhagen. In my master project, I investigated how human play roles in the taxonomic and functional diversity in Denmark.
