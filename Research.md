My research experience mainly refers to Macroecology, Remote Sensing, and ecological models. I focus on the selection, dispersal processes, asking how humans impact functional diversity. I am familiar with R, Matlab, and have some basic knowledge of Fortran.

### Geological and climate impact on the plant biodiversity in the Hengduan mountains
In my PhD, I am investigating and understand the impact of geological and climate processes on plant biodiversity patterns in the Hengduan Mts (HDM) – an exceptional biodiversity hotspot outside the tropics. I use species distribution models based on compiled occurrence data, to develop 1 km resolution biodiversity maps. With close collaboration of geologists and climatologists, I will try to link plant biodiversity patterns to geomorphological and climate processes in the Hengduan mountains.

### Output:
Impact of geogloical and climate processes on plant biodiversity patterns in the Hengduan mountains _(poster)_ [(PDF)](https://yaquanchang.github.io/poster_sdm.pdf)

Phytodiversity is associated with habitat heterogeneity from Eurasia to the Hengduan Mountains  _(paper)_ [(PDF)](https://yaquanchang.github.io/NP2023.pdf)

### Human impacts on functional diversity
In my master thesis, I am going to investigate human impacts on functional diversity. Before my master thesis, I did a project out of course scope to investigate a similar question but only based on Gribskov, Denmark. I used LiDAR and field derived variables to capture the functional diversity of woody plants and found that LiDAR-derived variables perform slightly better than field measurements.

### What else can species distribution model tell us?
I wrote my bachelor's thesis and a paper to investigate whether modelled habitat suitability could explain structural characteristics in a balsam fir dominated stand. I used species distribution models to simulate habitat suitability and related this to field-based site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG).

### Remote Sensing including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
I am crazy about the Remote Sensing approach as it’s really convenient for researchers investigating at a larger scale. I have used LiDAR and UAV products, including using LiDAR-derived variables to predict functional diversity (see the first topic). I have also learnt about using UAVs by comparing the performance of different platforms for processing UAV data.

### Forest dynamics
I learnt the basic concept of the forest dynamic models when I was an undergraduate student. I ran a process-based dynamic global vegetation model called the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ model) and calculated water use efficiency (WUE) of the forest in the Yangtze River basin, China.

#### Output
Special Award of 14th International Junior Forest Contest, Russian Federal Forest Agency
